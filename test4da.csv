Alexey,Korolev,"Spent half of my life preparing myself to pursue medicine, to follow family footsteps. After I realized I can't even memorize the list of human bones and that I am much better with numbers, I figured the best course of action for me is to dig into data-driven Healthcare industry. Close enough, right?

Some may say that such career path does not benefit the healthcare industry or the patients. But I beg to differ. Today, as an analyst in healthcare, I combine all available data, analyze it (""𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘴"", 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘯𝘰𝘸!) and push for appropriate changes and allow big guys up top make big decisions, Hopefully, the right ones. But that is already out of my hands. 

I am a ""data-nerd"". I could not care less about corporate politics. It bores me. Talking gets you nowhere, but actions do. Hook me up with dozen Excel files & I will do my magic. 

I firmly believe in employee empowerment, as it is the best way for the leadership to make appropriate and data-driven decisions in today's highly competitive and ever-changing environment.
