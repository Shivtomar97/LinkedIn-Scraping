# LinkedIn-Scraping

The aim of this project is to scrape linkedin profile of candidates

For this you need a linkedin recruiter mode!

The code will give you everything related to the candidates profile i.e.:

1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Title
4. LinkedIn Profile Link
5. Summary
6. Skills
7. Certifications
8. Experience (Company, Position, Location, Duration, Summary)
9. Education (University, Degree, Major, Location, Summary, Duration)

I have attached an excel file which is the final result of the code.

The code is easily modifiable as per requirements and need!
